/* JNI field and method signatures
- Field signatures are simply their type in JNI form.
- Method signatures are of the form "(argument-types)return-type" with no spaces.
The JNI form of all types are as follows:
bool:             "Z"
byte or uint8_t:  "B"
char or uint16_t: "C"
short:            "S"
int:              "I"
long:             "J"
float:            "F"
double:           "D"
array:            "[element-type"
class:            "Lclass;"
For example, a method that takes a String and two floats and returns an int would have the signature:
"(Ljava/Lang/String;FF)I"
Notably class names in JNI are also different - instead of "." they use "/", or "$" for nested types.
